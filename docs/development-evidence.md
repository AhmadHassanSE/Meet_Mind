# Development evidence

## 9 October 2026 — fresh Ollama foundation

This implementation was created with Codex assistance at Rana's direction. The initial commit uses the configured local Git identity; it does not represent independent implementation by all three members. Team members must review and understand code before claiming ownership in their report.

Implemented: React/TypeScript supporting UI, FastAPI local backend, TXT/basic VTT ingestion, SQLite persistence, structured source-linked extraction through local `llama3.2:latest`, model health status and input/error handling.

Observed checks before repository packaging:

- Two backend pytest tests passed: ingestion/persistence/missing record; blank input/basic VTT handling.
- Frontend TypeScript check and Vite production build passed.
- A real local Ollama smoke request extracted `Send the project report`, owner `Sara`, deadline `Friday`, source utterance 1. The first prompt missed this commitment; a first-person example was added and the rerun succeeded. This single example is not an extraction accuracy evaluation.
- Database connection cleanup was fixed after Windows exposed an open-handle issue during smoke-test cleanup.

Pending: review/edit persistence, AMI annotation/splits, baseline F1, BERT fine-tuning, spaCy, confidence evaluation, robust VTT parsing, broader tests and browser interaction validation. No external actions execute. SQLite is a temporary local choice; PostgreSQL remains the proposal target.

The reference prototype at the repository root remains separate from the active `meetmind/` implementation. Record future checks and each member's actual contributions in their PRs and milestone logs.
